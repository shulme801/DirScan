# DirScan Project

This project extends the final assignment of the excellent Udemy course "The Complete Python Developer Certification Course".

It allows the user to search for a list of words in all text files contained in a directory tree.  The driver program, "search_text_files.py" is invoked from the command line.  It takes command line arguments for

* The root of the directory tree
* List of words to search for in the text files in that directory tree

search_text_files.py prints, for each word specified on the command line, the number of time it was found in the text files in the directory tree.
